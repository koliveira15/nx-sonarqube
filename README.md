## About

A Nx plugin that scans projects using [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org)
/ [SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io).

![graph](https://i.ibb.co/whmZkm2/graph.png)

To analyze project "app", we need to know the its dependencies and sub-dependencies. Using the Nx project graph,
we see that this project has five dependencies, four static and one implicit. With this information,
the plugin gathers the source and coverage paths for the analysis.

Sources:

- apps/app/src
- libs/lib-b/src
- libs/lib-c/src
- libs/libs-d/src
- libs/libs-e/src
- libs/libs-f/src

lcov Paths:

- coverage/apps/app/lcov.info
- coverage/libs/lib-b/lcov.info
- coverage/libs/lib-c/lcov.info
- coverage/libs/libs-d/lcov.info
- coverage/libs/libs-e/lcov.info
- coverage/libs/libs-f/lcov.info

## Usage

### Prerequisites

1. Nx workspace
2. SonarQube or Sonar Cloud instance
3. Jest/Vite tests & code coverage enabled

### Installation

1. Install the package:
   ```bash
   npm i -D @koliveira15/nx-sonarqube
   ```
2. Execute the configuration generator to setup sonar for a given project:
   ```bash
   npx nx g @koliveira15/nx-sonarqube:config
   ```
3. Execute the sonar target for the given project:
   ```bash
   npx nx sonar my-project
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   npx nx affected --target sonar --parallel 1
   ```
   **Note:** Due to limitations with the scanner, you cannot run more than one scan in parallel

## Authentication

Sonar can require authentication credentials. You can set these via environment variables using [Nrwl's Nx recipe](https://nx.dev/recipes/environment-variables/define-environment-variables)

**SONAR_LOGIN:** The authentication token or login of a SonarQube user with either Execute Analysis permission on the project or Global Execute Analysis permission

**SONAR_PASSWORD:** If you're using an authentication token, leave this blank. If you're using a login, this is the password that goes with your SONAR_LOGIN username

## Customization

Modify the executor options based on the configuration table below. These options are based on [Analysis Parameters](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/analysis-parameters/)

In Addition, the plugin recognizes any environment variable that is prefixed by `SONAR` and will add it to the sonar executor variables. For example the environment variable `SONAR_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` will be recognized as `sonar.log.level=DEBUG`
